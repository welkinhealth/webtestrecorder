WebTest Recorder
================

This package lets you record all the requests and responses of an
application, and then create a doctest from that.  (There's no real
reason it couldn't be a unit test... just haven't written that yet.)

The recorder is a piece of middleware.  You use it like this::

    from webtestrecorder import record_file

    app = ... instantiate app ...
    app = record_file(app, '/tmp/record.txt')

All requests and responses will be written to this file.  You can read
them out like so::

    from webtestrecorder import get_records

    records = get_records(open('/tmp/record.txt', 'rb'))

``records`` is a list of requests, and each request has a
``.response`` attribute.  You can then create a test::

    from webtestrecorder import write_doctest

    write_doctest(records, open('/tmp/doctest.txt', 'wb'))

You can also use this like a shell script::

    $ python -m webtestrecorder < /tmp/record.txt > /tmp/doctest.txt
